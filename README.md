# Computational methods for engineering
Numerical and algebraic methods (interpolation, curve fitting, numerical differentiation and integration, ODE and PDE resolutions).
**Written in Python with the help of Sympy.**

The methods shared in this repository were created in the course "Computational mechanics II", from the Simon Bolivar University, in Caracas, Venezuela, dictated by professor Jesus Pinto.

This repository consists of 11 practices:
* Practice 1: Lagrange polynomial interpolation.
* Practice 2: Newton's polynomial interpolation.
